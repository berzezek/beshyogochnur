        The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate
        existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the
        same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their
        pronunciation and their most common words.

        Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one
        could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be
        necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.

        If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is
        more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new
        common language will be more simple and regular than the existing
        European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will
        be Occidental.
